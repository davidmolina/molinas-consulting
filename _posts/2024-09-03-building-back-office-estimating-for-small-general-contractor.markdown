<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat happens when you don't have systems, processes, and rules while scaling a six figure contracting company? A ton of profit bleed and chaos that can make any business owner question where the company is headed.</p>

# Challenge
The client is a small general contractor with two employees that had been doing very well financially but knew his people were limited in terms of contract procurement and technology/ estimating. The client's employees were using external hard drives to exchange information, but it was costing too much lost time and hindering the company's pace and progress.

# Solution
We paired w/ the owner and management team to build out the backoffice and create a master takeoff to prepare the company to bid a large government job. The master takeoff incorporated material, equipment, prevailing wage rates, indirect, overhead and true profit markups to ensure not only survival going into 2025 but a thriving, profitable business.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had a bulletproof backoffice to coordinate and synchronize operational efforts between bookkeeping and project management/estimating. As well, the tailored built master takeoff incorporated all direct, indirect, insurance/ bond, overhead and profit rates to bring radical transparency to scaling the contracting company.
