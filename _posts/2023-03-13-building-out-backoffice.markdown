<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow do you expand from residential contractor to commercial, government contracts? Operationalize the backoffice.</p>

# Challenge
The client managed to build out a successful residential portfolio in drywall and metal stud framing through an intricate web of hardcopies, outside professional services, and was burning the midnight oil in order to stay in business. The client was interested in pursuing larger pursuits but instinctively knew the current systems would not scale.

# Solution
We paired w/ the owner to build out a G:drive, including filemap (or sitemap), naming conventions, internal cashflow statements, and standard operating procedures for bidding new work. Through the consulting engagement we built out the the backoffice to scale the drywall/ metal stud framing company.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had an organized backoffice to build upon and scale the residential services company into larger commercial, government pursuits. The client was able to systematically build out each step to run the business. Operationalizing the backoffice is a must for operating a business in the 21st century.
