<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>here do you find a construction estimator to bid on a large scale, statewide government contract? You build it internally.</p>

# Challenge
The client hosted a variety of technical documents, prevailing wage and material costs on a desktop in a variety of folders and subfolders. Lack of a standalone master takeoff would prevent a crystal clear path to determine the value of x (unit cost) in an expedited fashion to bid and job cost projects accordingly.

# Solution
We built a standalone document that incorporated every moving component for a statewide janitorial services contract, including material, labor and indirect costs. The master takeoff mimicked a piece of software, but uniquely tailored and programmed for the client and was available online at all times for instant access and updating in the field.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had a clear visual to bid a large scale government procurement opportunity, modify indirect rates, overhead and profit costs to increase or decrease unit costs. The master takeoff was used to bid and be awarded a statewide contract and follow on contracts. The new easy-to-use tool was used to win future work and be profitable.
