<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow do you ensure a project bid with two rooftop units and a crane is profitable? You build your estimate in-house and include all indirect, overhead and profit costs.</p>

# Challenge
The client specialized in residential HVAC maintenance services and lacked the estimating systems and processes to bid larger commercial work. Lack of a standalone master takeoff would increase risk and prevent the owner to accurately account for all direct and indirect costs to determine the final lump sum number.

# Solution
We built a standalone document that incorporated every moving component for commercial HVAC opportunities, including material, labor and indirect costs. The master takeoff mimicked a piece of software, but uniquely tailored and programmed for the client and was available online at all times for instant access and updating remotely.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had a clear visual to bid its first large scale commercial HVAC opportunity, modify indirect rates, overhead and profit costs and determine the value of x. The master takeoff served as the basis to bid the company's largest commercial HVAC installment in its history and provided much needed structure.
