<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow do you scale a small consultancy practice without any real estate? Incorporate open source tools and decentralize everything.</p>

# Challenge
The client required a communication tool to avoid email bottlenecks, accelerate ideation and internal communication, and better coordinate delivery of services.

# Solution
We paired w/ the managing partner to develop a strategy around a remote/ decentralized operation, one that leverages APIs and open source tools to coordinate, integrate and synchronize consulting practice efforts all within a bootstrapped or zero budget.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had a well documented strategic roadmap, open source tools and remote/ decentralized office to coordinate the managing partners, and associated consultants to scale effectively. This included an intake form form for potential clients that directly tied into the communication app for expedient response times.

### At Molinas, we're known for building internal tools for maximum productivity, efficiency and optimal use of time. [Schedule consultation today](/contact).
