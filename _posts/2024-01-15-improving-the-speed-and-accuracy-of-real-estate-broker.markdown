<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat happens when your One Drive is not synchronizing to your desktop, files are missing and valuable opportunities are being lost? Decouple browser and password management.</p>

# Challenge
The client had previously used a tech specialist to support with IT requirements, purchases and installments and was relying heavily on YouTube videos but was losing valuable time to start the new year strong. In the world of real estate, where speed and accuracy is the name of the game, the client reached out for a two hour consultation to upgrade the laptop and bring it up to code.

# Solution
We paired w/ the real estate broker to upgrade browser, install security features, decouple password management, bookmark most heavily used real estate tools, create an online G:drive and streamline broker tools and files all in a secure and stable setting.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had a bulletproof backoffice to coordinate and synchronize broker efforts, a strong password management system, and safety-first browser to conduct remote business with clients in the field. Along with these rich features, the client also shaved some unnecessary expenses to direct towards marketing efforts and didn't have to buy a new laptop.
