<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat is the most efficient way to create an estimating team to submit a response to a government RFP? Build out backoffice and bid templates.</p>

# Challenge
The client came to us with a target bid, but no way beyond email to share files, plans, drawings & specs. The RFP was a large file document and no cover letter to respond.

# Solution
We paired w/ the owner to build out a G:drive, including filemap (or sitemap) and upload all RFP-related documents for quick access and review. Additionally, we created proposal templates for bidding not just the intended RFP, but all new project work. These templates would streamline business development for the clients target pursuits, saving both time and money in the future.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had an  organized backoffice to pursue government contracts and scale the company's estimating department. Ensuring everyone on the team could access files, documents and business development proposals ensures more bids go out and the owner can focus their time on more strategic efforts.

### At Molinas, we're known for building internal tools for maximum productivity, efficiency and optimal use of time. [Schedule consultation today](/contact).
