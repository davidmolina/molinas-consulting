<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>here do small general contracting company founders go to get setup to bid work? A founder that has been there and done it.</p>

# Challenge
The client founded the company after years serving as the no. 2 for another residential general contractor and coupled with general management experience in the private sector set out to start a new company. The small business owner had searched high and low for months to structure and setup the new general contracting company without much success.

# Solution
We paired w/ the owner to build out the backoffice, draft an operations handbook, develop naming convention rules, and install a password manager to store logins for the many websites in the government procurement marketplace. Through our engagement, we helped the client understand General Contractor/ Subcontractor Relations, contract compliance and payments terms so that the owner could make the most informed decision on pursuing work as a prime or subcontractor.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had decoupled browser and password manager to enhance cyber security, an operations handbook for continuity, backoffice to increase ownership and staff coordination and support services to clients, and correctly setup to scale methodically w/ the right set of tools and systems.
