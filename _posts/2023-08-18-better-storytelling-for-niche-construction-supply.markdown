<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow do you improve storytelling on a website to increase sales? Incorporate video b-roll of the very niche construction supply process.</p>

# Challenge
The client used a two-color palate on the company's website and vague on language to customers. The company's orders to major retails stores had dwindled during COVID-19 measures in many states across the country impacting the operational readiness of the company. 

# Solution
We paired w/ the owner to refine the business plan, growth strategies, and website branding with video b-roll of the supply chain manufacturing of the product. Through visual storytelling the company is able to paint a picture of the product and better carve out a niche in the highly competitive construction supply marketplace.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had a master takeoff that incorporated all direct, indirect, insurance/ bond, overhead and profit rates to ensure sustained profitability. This master takeoff served as the originating clone for future project takeoffs on project jobs and provided assurance to the client what their true costs were to clients.
