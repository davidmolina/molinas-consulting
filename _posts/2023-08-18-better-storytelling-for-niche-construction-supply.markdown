<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow do you improve a website to tell a story? Incorporate video b-roll of the very niche construction supply process and add graphical tag lines.</p>

# Challenge
The client used a two-color palate on the company's website and vague on tag lines/ mission statement to customers. The company's orders to major retails stores had dwindled over the years across the country impacting the operational readiness of the company and painting a bleak picture for the future. The owner was considering shutting it all down.

# Solution
We paired w/ the owner to refine the business plan, growth strategies, and website branding with video b-roll of the supply chain manufacturing of the product. Through visual storytelling the company is able to paint a picture of the product and better carve out a niche in the highly competitive construction supply marketplace.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had incorporated video b-roll of the niche supply chain process and two tag lines/ mission statements for visitors to the website. Being clear and visual has provided the company momentum to execute on there business plan into the niche supply marketplace.
