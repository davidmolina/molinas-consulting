<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow do you expedite the bidding process and ensure top quality pursuits? Implementing an online bidlog and Go/ No-Go process.</p>

# Challenge
The client owns a workforce consultancy practice and was in need of an easy to use, intuitive bidding process to pursue government bids. The client to this point was paper-based and relied heavily on calendars and notebooks which were prone to missing deadlines.

# Solution
We paired w/ the owner to move all desktop files (which had been lost once) to an online G:drive, create an online bidlog and create uniquely tailored Go/ No-Go processes to track, manage and coordinate highly sensitive information in a remote/ decentralized operating environment.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had an online server to share with their team, bidlog and no/ no-go process to better coordinate, integrate and synchronize the estimating and business development department.
