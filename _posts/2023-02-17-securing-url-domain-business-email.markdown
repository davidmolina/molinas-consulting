<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow do you scale a company with multiple personal emails, no website or business branding? You can't.</p>

# Challenge
The client used a variety of personal gmails mimicking business emails for multiple services and was facing mounting [technical debt](https://davidmolina.github.io/2023/06/28/avoid-technical-debt-and-duplication/). Services were not getting off the ground and was being ignored by multiple large businesses to do business due to branding inconsistency without a URL domain and business support email.

# Solution
We helped the client transfer unique URL domain to new domain registrar, propagate server, register and setup MX records and create one business email. The email hosted on Google leveraged a signature block to brand the owner, services and contact information for better branding. We tested the email in the browser and phone to ensure receipt. Through our strategy and listening session, we prepped wire frames and copy for the landing page for the owners' webmaster.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had complete command and control of there URL domain, a professional business email that matched the URL domain, and clear roadmap for moving forward to do business with large scale entities.
