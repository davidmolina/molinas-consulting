<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow do you mount a political campaign without much financial resources to your name? Incorporate open source tools and decentralize everything.</p>

# Challenge
The client is running for a political campaign with very little financial resources. Due to the expanded geography of the candidate's contended seat, the challenge with organizing that many people in one place can be cost prohibitive as well as very time consuming.

# Solution
We paired w/ the candidate and campaign manager to develop a strategy around a remote/ decentralized operation, one that leverages APIs and open source tools to mount a formidable campaign on a bootstrapped budget.

# Results
At the conclusion of the consulting engagement, the client had a well documented political roadmap to a contentious race, open source tools and remote/ decentralized office to coordinate volunteers and campaign staff.
