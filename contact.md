Molinas Systems Consulting works with contractors and regulated operators seeking greater operational clarity and margin discipline.

If you are evaluating an engagement, begin with a diagnostic conversation.

## How Engagements Begin

Most engagements start with a 1:1 Quick Call to determine fit and the right path forward.

From there, we move to either a 1:1 Strategy session or a 90m Diagnostic focused on operational discipline, cost governance, and execution clarity. We review estimating controls, overhead structure, workflow friction, and reporting visibility, then deliver a concise summary of findings and prioritized next steps.
