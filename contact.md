Molinas Systems Consulting works with contractors and regulated operators seeking greater operational clarity and margin discipline.

If you are evaluating an engagement, begin with a diagnostic conversation.

## How Engagements Begin

Most engagements start with a focused review of estimating controls, overhead structure, workflow friction, reporting visibility, and execution constraints. The objective is to identify where margin leakage or decision ambiguity exists and determine whether structured intervention is warranted.

Following the session, you receive a concise summary of findings and a prioritized path forward.

## Schedule a Call

<div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
  <div class="calendly-inline-widget"
       data-url="https://calendly.com/davidcmolina/15-min-office-hours-with-david?hide_gdpr_banner=1"
       style="min-width:320px;height:900px;">
  </div>
  <script type="text/javascript"
          src="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js"
          async></script>

## Implementation Support

For teams moving into execution, working sessions are structured to transfer documentation standards, dashboards, and workflow systems so your organization can operate independently and sustainably. Core leadership participation is recommended during implementation phases.
