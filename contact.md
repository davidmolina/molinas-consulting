After a combined 20+ years of service to country in uniform, various startups and companies ranging in size and customers I'm on a mission to channel these experiences and lessons learned to best help business owners exit and retire.

## How I Work

We will pair together and everything will live on your machine and phone. You should have some computer use familiarity and even more familiar with your business and line of work as you will have the ultimate responsibility to execute the work and implement the advice, step-by-step. You will receive years of experience and expertise compressed into a short amount of time. It is highly recommendable you have your project manager/ estimator and/ or assistant join the session.

## Diagnostics w/ David

I offer [Client Diagnostics](https://calendly.com/davidcmolina/59min) to help us diagnose objectively the problem and get to the root of the issue. During this 1-hour diagnostics we will unearth the issues facing your operation and at the end I will offer various recommendations and estimate hourly budget to fix some or all of the issue(s). Sometimes founders and entrepreneurs choose to take it from here, other times they book a few hours to have me pair with them to fix the issue together.

## Hourly w/ David

After the Client Diagnostics, you are welcomed to [book an hour](https://calendly.com/davidcmolina/60min). I recommend the Client Diagnostics first to ensure we understand the problem fully, but it's not always necessary. If we've already worked together and I'm familiar with your operation, feel free to book a two hour minimum to get started and locked into the calendar.

## e-Course w/ David
