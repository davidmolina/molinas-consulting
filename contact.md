After a combined 20+ years of service to country in uniform, various startups and companies ranging in size and customers I'm on a mission to channel these experiences and lessons learned to best [help business owners exit and retire](https://calendly.com/davidcmolina/15-minutes-w-david).

## How I Work

We will pair together and everything will live on your machine and phone. You should have some computer use familiarity and even more familiar with your business and line of work as you will have the ultimate responsibility to execute the work and implement the advice, step-by-step. You will receive years of experience and expertise compressed into a short amount of time.

## Diagnostics w/ David

I offer [Client Diagnostics](https://calendly.com/davidcmolina/59min) to help us diagnose objectively the problem and get to the root of the issue. During this 1-hour diagnostics we will unearth the issues facing your operation and at the end I will offer various recommendations and estimate budget to fix the issue(s). Sometimes founders and entrepreneurs choose to take it from here, other times they book a few hours to have me pair with them to fix the issue together.

## Hourly w/ David

After the Client Diagnostics, you are welcomed to [book an hour](https://calendly.com/davidcmolina/60min). I recommend the Client Diagnostics first to ensure we understand the problem fully. If we've already worked together and I'm familiar with your operation, feel free to book an hour.

## Half an Hour with David

Don't think the problem needs an hour to breakdown and resolve? Book a [30 minute call](https://calendly.com/davidcmolina/30min). Often times it might be what is needed to get accelerated expertise, plan of attack and answers to your most pressing business questions. A recap outline of recommendations is provided.
