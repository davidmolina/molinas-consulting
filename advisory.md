    Molinas Systems Consulting advises contractors and regulated operators on operational discipline, cost governance, and execution clarity.
  </p>
  <p>
    We work with construction, agriculture, and service-based enterprises to formalize estimating systems, reduce operational ambiguity, and build repeatable workflows that protect margin and support sustainable growth.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Work On</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Estimating systems and cost governance to improve project margins</li>
    <li>Clear decision-right structure across field and office teams</li>
    <li>Operational cleanup to reduce delays, handoff errors, and rework</li>
    <li>Targeted automation where reproducibility and reporting are critical</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Selected Outcomes</h2>
  <p>
    Developed and deployed a standardized estimating and cost-governance framework covering waste and overage buffers, insurance and bond allocation, overhead attribution, and execution velocity metrics surfaced through executive dashboards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implemented across 150+ contractors, the model produced an average profit improvement of approximately 33% by converting margin volatility into measurable performance control.
  </p>
  <p>
    Designed lead-to-dispatch routing systems for distributed 1099 contractor networks, reducing manual scheduling intervention by roughly 90% and accelerating response times from hours to minutes.
  </p>

  <h2>How Engagements Are Structured</h2>
  <p>
    Engagements begin with a focused diagnostic to identify margin leakage, workflow friction, and reporting blind spots. We define a short list of high-impact priorities, then work alongside your team to implement, document, and train.
